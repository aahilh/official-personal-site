<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-left: 100px; max-width: 1000px; margin-right: 200px;">The system I made is a full stack application that utilized React JS, Spring Boot, and MySQL. This application provides a listing of all products a distributor or store might have to offer. It also provides special access for users that want to manipulate products in display. It showcases the use of CRUD operations, which are important when working with backend.</p>

<p><u>Pokemon Weather App</u></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
<img src="photos/weatherappcover.jpg" style="display: flex; justify-content: left; align-items: left; width: 350px; height: 400px;">
<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-left: 100px; max-width: 1000px; margin-right: 200px;">This GUI application was made using JavaFX and its role is to read from two REST APIs to provide the user a response in accordance to the real time weather in that region. It determines if the weather would be suitable for a Pokemon that would inhabit the selected region. This project demonstrates the use of threads and processing data from APIs to form an output for the user.</p>
